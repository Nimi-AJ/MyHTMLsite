                <h2>Data Structures</h2>
                <p>Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. </p>

                <p>An indepth explanation can be viewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">here</a></p>

                <p>Â At the backbone of every program or piece of software are two entities: data and algorithms. Algorithms transform data into something a program can effectively use.</p> 
                <p>Therefore, it is important to understand how to structure data so algorithms can maintain, utilize, and iterate through data quickly.</p>
